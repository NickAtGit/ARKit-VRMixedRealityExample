# ARKit-VRMixedRealityExample

This is a proof of concept for a Mixed Reality Application with Apple's new ARKit.

I had to work around the fact that two ARSCNViews do not work together. Just one view gets the AR tracking. A replicator layer solved the problem. The performace is not too good though on an iPhone 7 Plus.

The application can be used in a Virtual Reality smartphone holder like Google Cardboard.
